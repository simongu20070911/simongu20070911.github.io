## Thesis

Markets are about to absorb multi-trillion-dollar AI infrastructure buildouts, new capital-intensive energy grids, and entirely different productivity curves. This page collects the modelling work I’m doing on those shifts—scenario engines, sensitivity tables, and company-level mosaics that tie bottom-up numbers to macro outcomes.

## Core Research Streams

### Abundant Intelligence (AI Infrastructure Supercycle)
- **What’s inside:** A full-stack model of Sam Altman’s 1 GW-per-week factory vision and the $1.63 T annual capex it unleashes.
- **Why it matters:** Shows which balance sheets carry the spend versus who prints incremental net income.
- **Read it:** [Abundant Intelligence: Who Wins a 52 GW per Year AI Build-Out]({% post_url 2025-09-24-abundant-intelligence-market-cap-scenario %})
- **Artifacts:** [Scenario data room]({{ "/assets/abundant-intelligence/" | relative_url }}) with Python model, CSV outputs, and stress charts.

### Competitive Moats in Accelerators
- **What’s inside:** Seven-powers analysis of NVIDIA vs. AMD plus valuation math under the same Altman-scale assumptions.
- **Why it matters:** Quantifies how multi-sourcing, ROCm maturity, and supply loosening can narrow the gap.
- **Read it:** [NVIDIA vs. AMD: Seven Powers, One Market Supercycle]({% post_url 2025-09-24-nvda-vs-amd-moat-analysis %})

### Financing the Future Grid (Coming Soon)
- **Focus:** Utilities, storage, and the cost of power for 52 GW/year of AI demand.
- **Status:** Collecting rate-book data and power purchase agreements; update on deck.

## How to Use This Page

1. **Start with the scenarios.** Run the CSVs and Python scripts to rebuild the numbers or plug in your own share/margin assumptions.
2. **Track the sensitivities.** Every 5 ppt swing in accelerator share is worth hundreds of billions in market cap—keep an eye on procurement disclosures.
3. **Watch financing signals.** Debt issuance, structured leases, and customer prepayments will show how quickly this capex supercycle can materialise.
