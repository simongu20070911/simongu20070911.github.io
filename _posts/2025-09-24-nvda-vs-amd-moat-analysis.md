## One-sentence take

NVIDIA’s moat is still expanding where it controls the stack (CUDA, system design), but the relative gap with AMD can compress as buyers force multi-sourcing, toolchains make ROCm viable, and supply bottlenecks loosen—while NVIDIA races to re-entrench with full-rack architectures and software subscriptions.

## The seven powers, side by side

| Power | NVIDIA (2025 status → trajectory) | AMD (2025 status → trajectory) | Gap outlook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scale economies** | Massive shipments fund priority HBM/CoWoS allocations and heavy software spend → absolute scale remains formidable even as bottlenecks ease | MI300X/MI355X scale across Azure, OCI, Meta → improves allocation and learning curves | Narrows slightly |
| **Network effects** | CUDA + CUDA-X + cuDNN + TensorRT + NIM → dense, path-dependent ecosystem, still widening | ROCm 7, PyTorch/vLLM support, Developer Cloud credits → rising usage from a low base | Remains wide |
| **Switching costs** | High in frontier training (custom kernels, fused ops), easing in inference via PyTorch 2.x, vLLM, Triton | Falling as ROCm matures and hyperscaler GA lowers migration friction | Narrows in inference |
| **Cornered resources** | Historically cornered HBM/CoWoS supply; capacity lifts into 2025–26 reduce exclusivity | Hyperscaler-backed contracts secure more supply; no longer at the back of the queue | Narrows |
| **Process power** | Rack-scale integration (NVLink, NVSwitch, GB200 NVL72) + software pipelines → compounding know-how | OCP-aligned systems, Pensando/Xilinx assets help but still years behind | NVDA lead holds |
| **Branding** | “Safe choice” for mission-critical AI, reinforced by GTC scale and certified ISVs | Credible alternative after Azure/OCI GAs and Meta production wins | Narrows slightly |
| **Counter-positioning** | Proprietary full-stack makes buyers nervous; strategic to hedge | Open ecosystem, clean second source, aggressive TCO pitch align with hyperscaler incentives | AMD advantaged |

## Why the gap can compress (12–36 month view)

1. **Inference first:** vLLM, PyTorch 2.x, and ROCm 7 make inference workloads portable—AMD’s fastest lane for share gains.
2. **Supply normalization:** TSMC’s CoWoS expansion (~70–90k wafers/month by 2026) and HBM ramps let buyers split allocations.
3. **Procurement policy:** Azure ND-MI300X GA, OCI MI300X GA, and Meta’s Grand Teton + MI300X show the “mandated second source” pattern that structurally assigns wallet share to AMD.

## How NVIDIA keeps the moat wide

- **System-level lock-in:** Treat the rack (NVL72) as the unit of compute. If your graph-parallel jobs depend on NVLink/NVSwitch topologies, switching hurts.  
- **Software subscriptions:** Monetise CUDA libraries, TensorRT, and NIM via enterprise SLAs—recurring revenue cushions hardware share loss.  
- **Strategic capital:** Mega-deals (e.g., proposed $100 B structure with OpenAI) secure demand but draw scrutiny; NVIDIA must manage partnerships without triggering regulatory backlash.

## Scenario math: Altman-scale build-out

Sam Altman’s “1 GW per week” factory line implies **52 GW/year**. At ~$50 B per GW (≈$35 B hardware + $15 B facilities), the AI stack would absorb **$2.6 T/year** of capex, with ~60% ($1.56 T) flowing to accelerators (GPUs + HBM + boards). This is the same base case I expand on in [Abundant Intelligence: Who Wins a 52 GW per Year AI Build-Out]({% post_url 2025-09-24-abundant-intelligence-market-cap-scenario %}).

![Scenario uplift for NVIDIA and AMD]({{ "/assets/abundant-intelligence/nvda_vs_amd_market_caps.png" | relative_url }})

### AMD 10× path (share-led upside)

- **Share assumption:** 30% of accelerator revenue (hyperscalers force multi-sourcing).  
- **Revenue:** 0.30 × $1.56 T ≈ $468 B.  
- **Net margin:** 22% (ROCm/software overhead, bundled HBM).  
- **Multiple:** 25×.  
- **Implied cap:** ≈ $2.6 T → ~10× today’s ~$261 B.  

Elasticity: every +5 ppt share adds ~$78 B revenue; at these economics that’s ≈ $430 B market cap.

### NVIDIA 4–5× hurdles

- **Baseline assumption:** 60% share (already a market-share haircut).  
- **Revenue:** 0.60 × $1.56 T ≈ $936 B.  
- **Net margin:** ~45%.  
- **Multiple:** 30×.  
- **Implied cap:** ≈ $12.6 T → ~2.8× today’s ~$4.47 T.  

To reach 4–5× (~$18–22.5 T), NVIDIA needs some combination of:  
1. **Share** ≈ 85%+ (unlikely if buyers enforce diversity).  
2. **Higher $/GW:** $70–90 B/GW pricing (well above the $50 B/GW yardstick Jensen Huang references).  
3. **Re-rating:** Sustained P/E >40× on trillion-dollar earnings despite regulatory overhang.

## Industrial realities shaping the upside

- **Law of large numbers:** NVIDIA already discounts much of the accelerator profit pool; AMD doesn’t. Same TAM lifts AMD multiples more.  
- **Custom silicon creep:** TPUs, Trainium, Maia carve out pieces of the pie, limiting merchant GPU share over time.  
- **Regulatory optics:** Massive capital tie-ups raise antitrust eyebrows (see DOJ interest in OpenAI deal).  
- **Software/network leverage:** NVIDIA’s best re-widening play is to turn CUDA/NIM/AI Enterprise into high-margin subscriptions and lock more value into NVLink/NVSwitch/Spectrum-X networking.

## Sources & corroboration (selected)

- Azure ND-MI300X v5, OCI MI300X general availability, Meta Grand Teton (MI300X) deployments.  
- AMD ROCm 7 release notes, vLLM ROCm paths, AMD Developer Cloud initiatives.  
- NVIDIA GB200 NVL72, NVLink/NVSwitch, NIM, TensorRT/cuDNN/CUDA-X updates from GTC 2025.  
- Micron commentary on HBM sell-out through 2026; TSMC disclosures on CoWoS expansion.  
- DOJ inquiries into mega AI partnerships; reports on custom silicon roadmaps (TPU, Trainium, Maia).

## Quick sensitivity dial

- **Relative uplift:** In the Abundant Intelligence base case, AMD’s market cap expands ~9× versus ~2.8× for NVIDIA.  
- Every **5 ppt share shift** ≈ ±$78 B revenue → ±$430 B cap (AMD) / ±$1.1–1.2 T (NVIDIA).  
- **$/GW** scales valuations linearly: if costs settle at $30 B/GW, take 60% of the figures above; if Blackwell-class systems trend to $60 B/GW, multiply by 1.2×.  
- **Software attach**: letting NVIDIA capture $50–100 B recurring software (10× EV multiple) adds $0.5–1 T upside independent of hardware share.
